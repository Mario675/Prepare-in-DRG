# How to make omens easier with the teams tools you have. 
# A guide to preparing.

# NOtes for author:

    If I ever make a video about this, which I probably wont, since that would take too long, I would put this in the description so that people can read this, at their own pace. 

    Host this on github, and put a release on it in the steam guideance page. 

    Remember those drone things? That's bad if you are in a trench, as you need to look up more, and you will not notice it until it is too late.

    Yes, the thing that you are dealing with is dangerus. you may have to run away. You may have to avoid it. But you are the one there to deal with the issue, so deal with it and shoot, so it isn't harrassing you anymore. 

## Engie:

    ### The above method.

        Locate the omen platform that enables you to damage the twin slicer. 

            It should be opposite to the omen key inserter.

        Place a platform above that activator platform.

            The height should be far enough away, so that:

                1. Your legs don't get sliced off

                2. Close enough that it will still enable the omen platform.

                Don't worry if it isn't close enough to enable the omen platform. You can mine in the middle of the platform to make an indent. 

                    The indent also helps the player center themselves unto the platform, so they don't just need to rely on sound to make sure they are there. 

        From the omen platform that has the twin slicers, make two `fingers` that branch off to the other omen platforms. 

                

    ### The walls method.

        If you have walls around, you can place platforms there for your team to use, and for your turret. 



    ### Fighting bugs

        (This advice was taken from a fellow reditor on DRG subreddit. I don't remember his name, but I'll try to locate the source.)

        Here's a concept to add to your repretiore!
        
        GTP, or Got to prepare.

        Look at the envioment around you. 

            Is it a good area to fight?

            Is it a good area to prepare?

        A good time to prepare is when mission control calls out if there is a swarm. 

        A non prepared engie, is a dead engie. 

            If you are carrying proximity mines:

                Beware of their placement. Remember the annoyance of getting blown up by friendly fire by being in the yellow bubbles.

                    1. Place them out of your teamates way, far, far away. 

                    2. Place them on walls too! They prefer the path that is shortest to you, not the ground most of the time. 


            Use your platforms (with repellant) to guide the pathfinding of the bugs to your proximity mine.


            Place your turrets.

                Make sure your turrets are not obstructed by the envioment. Be sure they can see more than you do, above the platforms, beyond the walls of the caves. 

            
            Use your weponds also

                Your Turrets may not be able to deal with ranged, or impermiable enimies. (Acid spitters, menance. Oppressor.)



## SCOUT:

    While the others will have to handle dodging and shooting:

        LIGHT UP THE CAVE!

            Your light is still very important for your team. 

                It creates more contrast for the eyes to identify targets, and thus allow your team to shoot better.

                If you help keep your team alive, they will help keep you alive, by wave killing the bugs faster than you can. 

        You can also use the platforms that engie created as a safe spot from the twin slicers. 

        ### Shooting tips

            I would recommend to have a target priority when shooting bugs. 

                Remember the bugs that kill you the most in higher hazard levels?

                        Acid Spitter

                        Menace

                        Exploder

                    These bugs AND OTHERS, has the potential to deal a lot of single target damage. 

                        You only have _three_ teamates keeping you alive from the wave of bugs. 

                            Imagine a pie cut in three. Each time you lose a teamate, you lose all the damage potential output of that class.


            #### Notes about the ultimate locomotion scout has, and dealing with bugs.

                Scout cannot hold his ground against too many enimies. 

                    See what fetures of the cave that you can ultilize to grapple to. 

                Yes, you can kite enimies to avoid them. Kiting is very good if you are in a situwation in which you cannot stand your ground. 

                With the locomotion you have, you can get to the enimies faster than everyone else, and deal with them. 

                    Everyone has to deal with these enimies. It's a distraction from the objective. Another thing to deal with. They have their methods of disposing them has quickly as possible, so why shouldn't you?

                    You can leave from the group, to deal with your own group of enimies, and make the swarm easier for the team. 

                        Bonus points if you can get to the macteria spawning cloud and get rid of them with cryo, before the team deals with them.

                    
                    However, REMEMBER that if things get too overwhelming, go back to your team.

                        Don't die off in the distance, otherwise, you will be a burden for your team. 

                            They don't have light without you. 

                            They don't have a team member of dealing single target damage, like getting rid of acid spitters.

                Use your Utility!

                    Your cryo grenade can help save a lot of ammo.

                        With cryo on the enimies, you deal four times the amount of damage that you wouldn't otherwise get. 

                    The cryo grenade can be used to make a group of enmies still.

                        This helps you and your team:
                        
                            Get rid of the large clump. 

                            Focusing the attention on something more important. 

                                Menance, objective, surviving extracton. 


                When all of your teamates are down, or your team is in a tough spot.

                    It really pays for you to travel and think of a plan. 

                        If there are too many bugs to deal with, wait. 

                            It's better to think of a game plan to deal with the bugs, rather than throwing cryo, and hoping they don't get you. 

                                There are acid spitters, Menace, Opessors, that you may have not gotten with your cryo.


                AND BEFORE YOU LEAVE, check where your teamates are, and light up the cave before you go!

                    Understand that they don't have access to a powerful flare gun (like you do), anytime they want constrast for seeing.


## Driller

    The terrian to navigate in can be light and day. 

        It can be your ally, or your worst enimy. 



    A good rule of thumb to keep in mind is:

        "What if I needed to be right there?"

            "What if I was in swarmed, and need some room to fight?"

            "What if I needed to cross this gap? What then?"

            "What if I needed to exit this room right away, but there's a wall preventing me from going to the next room. 

        With that in mind, look around and see what you can do about it to make the terrain better.

            It should be good enough, if you start using your own tunnel more than once to get to places. 

                Preparing for a dreadnaught fight.

                Digging a tunnel alternative back so your team can leave faster. 



            Even better if your teamates use it. 


    Another thing to consider is opening sightlines for your team to see. 

        For example if you are on a salvage operation, you need to stay in one place.

            A great benifit for your team is the ability to see enimies before they get there.

            > A NOTE FOR ENGINEERS:

                Please keep in mind this tip.
                    
                    Your roof is very handy for protecting your team from macteria, yes.

                    But could you please build it higher, so that your teamates can see the bugs on the above walls?

            If you can clear out terrain around the objective:

                It takes longer for the bugs to get to you. 

                You can see the bugs for a longer time before they kill you. 

                And thus, you can shoot them.

            Imagine a bug coming around the corner. How much time does it take before the bug gets to you, and for you to begin shooting the bug?

                Optimize that time, to make it easier for your teamates.




    If you are on a difficulty in which the terrian is absolutly, horribily generated (Hollow Bough with lots of virtical generation)

        You may want to dig a bunker. There are several types of bunkers, depending on the ammo.

        Before you build a bunker:

            You are basically saying: "The envioment around me is worse than this bunker I'm about to create"

                And if that is not so, rethink it before you spend the ammo. 

            Check in with your teamates, before putting the objective in a bunker. They may not agree with your playstyle. Gunner might prefer the open view and freedom more.

        Building a bunker:




## Gunner

    Shield

        Yes, your sheild is great for gareenteing a revive. Yes it's good for keeping you protected. 

        But also keep in mind:

            Your shield could also help to prevent your teamates __from__ danger. 

            Throw the shield down before you need it. This give you time to:

                Switch wepons, see around, fire. 

                For your teamates to see, and get into the shield.

            The sheild is under ultilized for blocking enimies. If you don't want the enimies over whelming you or somthing, 

                The shield is a nice barrier to protect dorreta,
                
                To guard agaist bugs going into a tunnel,

                To manipulate the pathfinding of the enimies in the tunnel, so you can keep your gun aimed at one spot. 

        
        If you don't run out of shields before the next resupply sesson, you are not using your sheilds enough. 

    Ziplines

        Yes, the ziplines are a low method of transport. 

        But also keep in mind:

            They are a great way to:
            
                Quickly transport ores across huge gaps.

                To help you and your teamates keep afloat against the bugs on the ground. 

            
        Ziplines are extreamly useful for scout and teamates because:

            Scout doesn't need to rotate his placement to shoot.

            Scout doesn't need to spend ammo to get to different areas to shoot. 

            Scout doesn't need to be be stressed to avoid ground enimies.
        

        Some exceptions for ziplines:

            do not die on a zipline by a bulk, or dreadnaught.

                Most of the time You will be ejected from the zipline, before this happens.

                But be fearful that if there isn't anything to stand on, and in range for reviving you on the zipline, 

                    You may be simply stuck there.

            One can repetatly mount and dismount the zipline so that you are still on the zipline so that:

                Mactera doesn't knock you off.

                You could technically go faster than the zipline, if you are fast enough.

                But remember this is a risky technique, and you may fall off the zipline reguardless.
